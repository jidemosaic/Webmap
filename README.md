# Webmap
This is a webmap built with Python using the Folium Library. It is powered by the Open Street Map. To explore and modify the Python file locally, you may need to install Pandas and Folium Packages by using the pip function in your Windows, Mac or Linux command prompt. Python must be installed on your OS to achieve this.
